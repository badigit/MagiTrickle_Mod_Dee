# nettrace

Per-process network diagnostic for verifying MagiTrickle routing — captures
**all outbound connections of a process, TCP _and_ UDP**, and annotates each
destination against MagiTrickle (`/api/v1/lookup`) plus ASN/country.

## Why not the PowerShell script

`network_watch.ps1` reads socket tables (`Get-NetTCPConnection` /
`Get-NetUDPEndpoint`). That works for TCP, but **UDP has no connection state** —
the endpoint table exposes only the *local* socket, never the remote address.
So the old script showed UDP as `local endpoint only` and was blind to where UDP
actually went (games, QUIC, etc.).

`nettrace` instead subscribes to the **ETW `Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-Network`
provider**, which emits a per-packet event carrying **PID + destination IP:port**
for both TCP and UDP. This is the only Windows source that ties a UDP datagram to
both its process and its destination.

## Requirements

- Windows 10 1809+ / 11
- Python 3.9+
- **Administrator** — ETW kernel sessions require elevation. Run from an elevated
  shell.

```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

```powershell
# watch Rocket League, TCP+UDP, until Ctrl+C, with MT + ASN annotation
python nettrace.py -n RocketLeague

# multiple processes, 60 seconds, also write TSV
python nettrace.py -n chrome -n RocketLeague --for 60 --tsv out.tsv

# by PID, UDP only
python nettrace.py --pid 12345 --no-tcp

# first elevated run — dump raw ETW field names (to validate field mapping)
python nettrace.py -n RocketLeague --debug-fields
```

### Output

```
[02:41:59] [RocketLeague] UDP 18.156.229.255:8097 [MT:--]        AS16509 | Amazon | DE
[02:41:59] [RocketLeague] TCP 104.18.2.64:443     [MT:CF] [x1]   AS13335 | Cloudflare | US
```

Color = MagiTrickle intent (not actual path — see limitation):
- **green** — destination matches an MT rule / is in an ipset → *should* be tunneled
- **yellow** — not covered by MT → will go DIRECT
- **gray** — RU (excluded from tunneling by convention)

`[MT:<group>]` = matched rule group · `[MT:ipset]` = in live ipset only ·
`[MT:--]` = not in MagiTrickle.

## Key flags

| flag | meaning |
|------|---------|
| `-n NAME` | process-name substring (repeatable) |
| `--pid N` | filter by PID (repeatable) |
| `--for N` | run N seconds (0 = until Ctrl+C) |
| `--mt-url URL` | MagiTrickle lookup endpoint (default from `ROUTER_IP` / `.router.env`; `''` disables) |
| `--no-check-ipset` | rule-match only, skip live ipset query |
| `--no-udp` / `--no-tcp` | restrict protocol |
| `--no-geo` | skip ASN/country lookup |
| `--ipinfo-token TOKEN` | ipinfo.io token; defaults to `$IPINFO_TOKEN`, empty = anonymous endpoint |
| `--tsv PATH` | also write TSV log |
| `--append` | append to existing `--tsv` instead of overwriting |
| `--resolve-hostnames` | reverse-DNS (PTR) each destination IP |
| `--port-swap` | `ntohs()` ports — only if they look byte-swapped (443 shown as 47873) |
| `--repeat-every N` | reprint a repeating endpoint every N hits (1=every hit, 0=never; default 25) |
| `--debug-fields` | print raw ETW field names of the first event |

## Learn & push to MagiTrickle

Instead of eyeballing the miss-list and adding rules by hand, `nettrace` can collect
uncovered destinations (with **real BGP-announced CIDR** + ASN, not a `/24` guess) and
push them into an MT group. Two workflows:

### Two-step (recommended): learn, then push

```powershell
# 1) play a few sessions — accumulate candidates (counts add up across runs)
python nettrace.py -n RocketLeague --learn game.json
python nettrace.py -n RocketLeague --learn game.json   # again next match

# 2) review the plan (dry-run — nothing is written)
python nettrace.py --import game.json --push-to-group RL

# 3) actually add
python nettrace.py --import game.json --push-to-group RL --confirm
```

`--import` is **push mode**: no capture, just read the store, refresh coverage against
live MT, aggregate uncovered IPs into subnets, and add the ones not already present.

### One-shot (capture + push in a single run)

```powershell
python nettrace.py -n RocketLeague --for 120 --push-to-group RL --confirm
```

### Aggregation & safety

| flag | meaning |
|------|---------|
| `--learn FILE` | accumulate captured endpoints (ASN + BGP-CIDR) into a JSON store |
| `--import FILE` | push mode: add uncovered subnets from a store to MT (no capture) |
| `--push-to-group G` | target MT group (name or id) |
| `--confirm` | actually push (default is **dry-run**) |
| `--agg cidr\|aws\|24\|16\|32` | `cidr` = BGP prefix (default), `aws` = official AWS regional prefix, or fixed mask |
| `--min-count N` | ignore endpoints seen fewer than N times (drop noise) |
| `--promote16 N` | with `--agg 24`: collapse a /16 when ≥N distinct /24 seen |
| `--allow-wide` | permit subnets wider than /16 (needed for `aws`/`cidr`) |
| `--aws-ec2-only` | `--agg aws`: only EC2 prefixes (skip S3/CloudFront) |
| `--aws-regions R1,R2` | `--agg aws`: restrict to these regions |
| `--aws-refresh` | `--agg aws`: force re-download of the cached ip-ranges |

### Aggregation modes

- **`cidr`** (default) — the IP's real BGP-announced prefix (via bgpkit). Accurate to
  how the owner routes it, but can be wide (`/14` for AWS).
- **`aws`** — looks the IP up in AWS's official `ip-ranges.json` and uses the **regional
  prefix**, naming the rule after the region (`AWS eu-central-1`). The file is cached
  locally (`aws-ip-ranges.cache.json`, 7-day TTL). Best when you want to tunnel whole
  AWS game regions reliably — pair with `--allow-wide` (regions are large by design) and
  optionally `--aws-ec2-only` / `--aws-regions`. Non-AWS IPs fall back to `/24`.
- **`24` / `16` / `32`** — fixed mask. `--agg 24 --promote16 2` is the narrow-but-adaptive
  middle ground (see below).

Only **uncovered** (not already in MT), **non-RU**, IPv4 candidates are pushed; existing
rules are deduped; subnets wider than `/16` are refused unless `--allow-wide`. This
replaces `mt_add_missing.ps1`.

This fully replaces `network_watch.ps1` + `mt_add_missing.ps1` (TCP-only, UDP-blind).

## Troubleshooting: "it lags" / "it captures nothing"

Four independent causes were found and fixed on 2026-08-31 while chasing an AnyDesk
capture that looked frozen. If output ever looks wrong again, check these in order.

### The capture itself is almost never the problem

`etw_probe.py` settles that in one elevated run. It opens three Kernel-Network
sessions — old event ids with stock pywintrace buffers, the extended id list, and
the extended list with nettrace's own buffers — filters nothing by process, and
just counts what arrives:

```
python etw_probe.py 15
```

Each phase runs as its own child process, because `ProcessTrace` can block for a
long time inside `stop()`; numbers are printed *before* the stop and the child then
hard-exits. It also prints a per-PID table with resolved process names, whether the
name you are filtering on was seen at all, and `EventsLost`. Set `PROBE_MATCH` to
look for something other than AnyDesk.

### Delivery lag: ETW buffers

pywintrace allocates 1 MB buffers and leaves `FlushTimer` at 0, so a real-time
session only hands events over once a buffer fills. Kernel-Network events are tiny,
so that is tens of seconds of apparent freeze. nettrace now uses 64 KB buffers with
`FlushTimer = 1`.

### Delivery lag: enrichment

ASN/country/PTR are 1-3 blocking network round-trips per new IP. Inline they stalled
the print loop for seconds per endpoint and made the `[HH:MM:SS]` stamp the time of
*printing* rather than of the event. They now run off-thread; a line waits for its
lookup in an ordered buffer for at most `--geo-hold` seconds (default 5) and then
prints unenriched, so one dead lookup cannot freeze the live view. The result still
lands in the cache, so `--learn` and the summary keep ASN and CIDR either way.

### "It only caught it once"

Repeat hits of the same `(protocol, PID, IP, port)` are suppressed — printed on the
2nd hit, then every Nth. On a long-lived connection that reads as "it stopped
tracking". Use `--repeat-every 1` to see every hit, `0` to silence repeats entirely.

### "It caught nothing at all"

An established, idle connection generates almost no `datasent` events — that is what
the event *means*. Two fixes:

- `connect`/`accept` events are captured now, so you see the moment a connection is
  established rather than the first payload. Start the capture *before* reconnecting.
- `--recv` adds inbound events. On an idle keepalive channel there is usually more
  inbound than outbound, so without it you see half the picture.

Filtering by `--pid` sidesteps process-name matching entirely. Beware that a service
gets a new PID whenever it restarts:

```powershell
$a = @(); foreach ($i in (Get-Process AnyDesk).Id) { $a += "--pid"; $a += "$i" }
python nettrace.py @a --recv --repeat-every 1 --for 20
```

### Ports looked byte-swapped

The port arrives from ETW already in host order. nettrace used to apply another
`ntohs()` on top by default, which printed port 443 as 47873 (`ntohs(443) = 47873`).
The swap is off by default now; `--port-swap` restores it if some build needs it.
Cross-check a live connection against `Get-NetTCPConnection -OwningProcess <pid>`
before believing a port.

## Limitations (v1)

- **Shows intent, not actual path.** MT annotation says whether a destination
  *should* be tunneled (rule/ipset). It does **not** prove the packet actually went
  through the tunnel — that only the router knows (conntrack `sport=5001` /
  mihomo `/connections`). Router path cross-check (TUNNEL vs DIRECT) and a
  test-case mode are planned — see beads `mt-wf4`.
- **ETW field names / byte order** for the Kernel-Network provider are validated
  at runtime; if IPs or ports look wrong on your build, run `--debug-fields` and
  adjust, and try `--port-swap`.
